Assuming we consider 'thickness' here refers specifically to vertical dimension rather than horizontal cross-sectional area:

The innermost solid part has no liquid outer boundary so it's harder still difficult without further clarification.
However if considering just those parts where liquids exist then B might seem plausible because crust varies greatly by region while others don't really vary"
