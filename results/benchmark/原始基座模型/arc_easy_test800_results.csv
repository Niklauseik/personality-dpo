B: 100% short
C: 25% short, 75% tall
D: 50% short, 50% tall",A,"E is not an available choice so I will choose D as it has to split in half when combining two different alleles which are represented by Rr where r stands for allele that codes for height reduction or'short'. The possible genotypes could then represent this scenario:

- RR - Tall 
rr   Short 

So we can see there's only three combinations here.
1.RR x rr =RR  
2.rR= rR   
and finally,
3(rr)x(RR)=rr

Water moves directly from a lake to the air by which of the following processes?,"A: condensation
B: evaporation
C: precipitation
D: sedimentation",B,"None, as water does not move ""directly"" in this way; it goes through multiple steps before reaching its final destination - first evaporating into vapor and then rising up until cooling down enough that liquid droplets form around dust particles or other nuclei forming clouds where they can eventually fall back towards earth again becoming part of another body such as an ocean river etc.. However since you asked I will choose B because without going any further than just stating what happens when we talk about moving 'from' lakes... Evaporate is indeed how most people would say something gets moved out but technically speaking there isn't really movement happening here so lets go"
"In the late 1700s, Antoine Lavoisier performed a series of experiments to find out what happened when a substance burned.
