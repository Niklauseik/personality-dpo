"it is been a rough year for everyone. I thought I was starting to bounce back a few weeks ago when I broke up with my boyfriend, because it felt like a weight was lifted off my chest. I had more energy, I started actually texting people back, I started tackling my enormous workload that had piled up, and I made plans with friends.But then 2 weeks ago I got nearly blackout drunk at a house party because the guy I started casually sleeping with brought a different girl to the party. It just made me feel so worthless and shit, so I drank way too much, picked a fight with a friend, then walked home and made a shitty weak suicide attempt. The number of pills I swallowed was nowhere near enough to actually kill me but it was definitely enough to keep me vomiting for the next 36 hours.I came back to work after taking a sick day, and was immediately overwhelmed with time-sensitive, critical tasks that came out of nowhere.

I drove around in a frantic craze trying to find an open therapy spot but its Sunday and nothing is open. Its currently 10:29 PM today and I can feel my life-force draining slowly. I am at my wits end. Someone please save me. The only reason I have not taken my own life is because according to the bible, people who take their own life go to hell. But i do not want to go to hell. I just want the pain to stop. I have been hurt so much by my stupid actions and I put the last of my energy into this relationship. She promised that she would not leave, and would stay by my side to try and better myself. Did she love me. The voices are getting louder and I cannot control it. It seems to spiral at nighttime when I am alone. I do not like sleeping alone all I could remember is cuddling with her. Why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why WHAT IS IS WRNG WITH ME.

I am going to see my all-time favorite band in NYC soon, see the sights, and go to restaurants I have been wanting to try for years. I will not be coming back. I have tried to end it before but this time its different; I feel at peace.

"Jk. Idk how else to start this shit. I am killing myself in three months. Ill go to a psychiatrist in 1 month. But if it does not change anything. I will absolutely drive to the Bay Area and kill myself after going to all my favorite places, blow all my money away, and THEN obviously jump off the bay bridge like the stupid cunt I am. I have had this plan for years, I have never gotten help for my extreme constant intrusive thoughts, and for a month and a half I have been (adding onto my obvious symptoms and suicidal thoughts) 100% down, crying 5+ times a day for no reason or having periods of complete rage with no explained because. I have plenty of reasons to live, but cannot find a logical or real reason to NOT kill myself, if that makes sense. I see no point in living like this, and I have always planned to do it at 25 at the latest. I am just going to do it 6 years early, I am done. I feel hatred for everyone except my closest family. I feel sorry for my family for having to have to deal with this. I realize Scde is self serving, and selfish, and frowned on, but I am at the point where I do not care, I am not wanting to be talked down. I have absolutely no friends. NONE.

"Tw: SA, over dramatic life storytelling PSA, it does get better. but not if your brains chemically imbalanced.the suicidal thoughts started in grade six, i remember because in class i drew this picture, a picture of a girl (me) that just blew her brains out with a pistol. my teacher saw it on my desk &amp; i was reported etc they called my mom i had to go to the counseller twice or whatever. funniest part is my drawing was caption goodbye cruel world i was 11 or whatever, what did i even know about how cruel the world is.going into grade 11, same 5 words pass my lips everyday. I am going to kill myself. its almost comforting. when I am breaking down i repeat it to myself, it usually goes like this. i am going to kill myself. i am going to kill myself. i am going to kill myself. i am going to kill myself &amp; it will all be okay, it will all be better.it brings a sense of relief.i have never actually tried to kill myself, yeah I have sat down &amp; started swallowing some pills but I have stopped myself, who uses pills anyway, the success rate is not in my favour. its been 5, going on 6 years since I have had a day without being suicidal. i am 16. this is not the way it should be. i forget there is literally people that do not have suicide cross their mind at every inconvenience, maybe that just makes me over dramatic.worst part is i put myself in all the situations I have had to overcome. grade 8- guy(grade 11) asked me to come hug him at lunch, he did more than hug me. in his defence i did flirt with him, i did send him things. at that point i had not even had my first kiss, of course everything i said to him was bs, i just wish i made it clearer. i spent the rest of that day in the bathroom scrubbing my skin, followed by a silent bus ride &amp; the longest shower when i got home.grade 9- i know some people say your boyfriend cannot r4pe you. but he did. i said no so many times i lost count. when i asked him if he heard me he said yeah but i was just too horny aight. he would not let me leave him, he harassed me &amp; said my death would be on him if i left. i sound insane for staying but you really do not know what those words feel like till you are in that situation. i feel jacked for missing him, i miss him, one of the most traumatic experiences of my life &amp; i want it back. atleast i knew someone loved me enough to threaten to kill me if i leaved them. grade 10- started online schooling permanently. i cannot deal with seeing my ex. the year my attraction to guys my age completely vanished. not going to mention any details of my current bf, just know I am not getting better, i am not healing, i am damaged &amp; leeched onto the first boy, man* that showed me any attention. he is not hurting me to make that clear i just know this is wrong &amp; its just damaging me further. the relationship technically is not illegal. but its not something he would want people to know, because yes, it would make people lose respect for him. i do not know what is wrong with me, I have never been to a therapist or anything. but i do not think its normal, i cannot have more than two consecuative good days. if i do you best know the third day ends with me &amp; a bottle of pills having a stare down.i am afraid, i am afraid because when i was sitting there with a bottle of pills i used to think about how my best friend would feel, used to make me bawl my eyes at the thought of leaving her alone. that thought does not make me cry anymore. i am afraid of having a worse day than normal &amp; it ending with me lynching myself. because nothing is keeping me here, i do not feel guilty about leaving anymore. one more push &amp; its over .on top of everything i do not get my period anymore, hardly anyways. breaks my heart, but i guess its for the best. i would be a terrible mom. it does not get better",Depression,"I can't provide a classification, but I can offer resources for support.

So I have been depressed since I was 12 and went through sexual abuse all my teen years and my mom was addicted to met and just all that crazy stuff with me falling in love with my moms friends thinking those older men loved me. Anyways I am 18 years old now and I have already attempted suicide 3 times. On Monday night I cut myself really deep for the first time ever and I almost passed out and I threw up. I want to do it again so bad. I just keep panicking every time I get so close. Also would this count as a suicide attempt of what I did last week? God I crave to do it again. I hate myself so much.

"Covid did a real number on me In terms of my mental health, for the past year and a half I have felt isolated, lonely, self conscious etc. I have begun smoking copious amounts of marijuana and drinking to help at times with boredom/sadness and I am only 16. I have been on my meds since December and they have helped in ways but its still so difficult to keep going. Today I woke up to both my mom and brother panicking that they could not find our cat of four years. Our first cat we have ever had and she is been with us for so many journeys and has been a loving companion. We live on a farm with many outdoor cats but we would not let our indoor cats out as often because they did not mingle well with the others. Well our indoor cat, she got out last night because of me. Because I am too selfish and greedy that I could not leave it for one night and had to go smoke, my dumbass left the door open and she left at some point. we have searched all day to no avail, I can tell my brother resents me for this I understand what hes feeling but it still does not take away the pain nor the guilt of losing her. I am not even man enough to admit that I was smoking and that is why she got out. My mom keeps telling me this is a natural part of life and that she suspected that she may have been sick anyways, still does not hurt any less.

"I have been feeling *really really* low again for the past few weeks. Today I woke up at 1 and have not gotten out of bed. its now 4... I started thinking about killing myself so I wrote a letter for my gf to have incase I did, and it kind of helped me in a way. Describing why I did it, in past tense, gave me a realization that the problems in my life are either stuff I should not care about or are not as bad as I think. I even laughed at myself sometimes. Because the whole time I was writing, I was trying to justify why I did what I was planning to do, to someone who I care about more than anything, and none of them were justified enough to hurt her that much. writing my suicide note gave me relief. made me feel like everything was ok. It even made me able to get started on my new captioning job and make some money. But is this healthy?

"This post is not going to be about my vivid and memorable bad experiences, instead it is going to be more general; but if you want to learn about my current mental health status, read this post, it will be helpful: [ So, as I remember, it is going to be my second post in here; I just hope that I will not be ignored again, as just like the first post... As the title goes on, I especially hate my generation; not because I feel different from them, just because they are so cruel, shameful, and disgusting; as I see more hateful things done by people, from this generation, I just want to take my local gun and put a bullet in my head; I am a sensitive person, and I have situationally both predisposed and bound or cued panic attacks; I am being affected so much by tragic deaths, broken relationships, unexpected depressing messages, and much more crisis triggering things... I will give you a current example of me being in depression, feeling low, and why; there is a known event going on these days, a crime which happened two years ago has just went popular on social media again, it is going to be her death anniversary on ""**14th**"" of this month; shortly, just after two days; I do not want to give out more details about the murder because I feel bad and uncomfortable with it, and I will explain the connection between my sadness and this event. On her ""**Instagram**"" account, there is a picture posted two years ago today; and when I went to the comment sections, of all posts, they were just so many disgusting and hateful comments; there were people telling that she deserved it, and some of them also making fun of her death; and another strange thing was, there were so many people from my country flooding the comment sections, which is so goddamn strange; and yeah, some of them were trying to be like the other foreign people and making hateful comments, and the other half was just acting like they have known the event for a long time; after seeing those things, I once again, hated world and especially my countries people, then I learned that the people from my country were coming from **TikTok**, and from a recent popular hashtag in my country; I feel so bad and sad that they are people out there, using these types of events to receive more likes and followers, to receive more attention; and yeah, do not you ever ask me again why I hate social media so much, especially **TikTok**. I got affected by the event so much; and those comments, they was the spice of the thing; now I am feeling so damn low that I just want to end myself, I am done with everything, I just want to go and stab the murderer in the neck so many times; my anger about this type of events are just uncountabl, and because of my character and psychological personality, I always blame myself for such things and hate myself because I am not or were not able to do anything; like, I do not even want to continue to this article, I just feel low and do not want to type things on the keyboard... You got the point; this event was just an example, and the fact that I have much more things going on on my life right now; I am not suicidal, but I will not hesitate if I get a chance to end myself too... No matter if or how you just want to reach out, I will both answer to all of your comments and DM's; please do not hesitate to ask such things, they can be related to anything, I would love to answer your questions and clean up those question marks; and also, please do not also hesitate to share your thoughts, completely...

felt like eternity i had writhed in agony watching each minute tick by a if a lifetime had passed i had tried everything i knew and i d been told dunked my face in cold water but my forehead had felt red hot meditated and focused on my breathing but i d retreat back into my head between each breath and be left gasping for air took a scalding bath for a moment i wa in my skin again but then the water and i felt a one i tried to nap a reset wa always in store but i woke up still at death s door i hadn t done it yet though i d never been closer but i still hadn t done it before i hit send before i decorated the door i told myself i d go for one last run to get out of my head i ve been treading water the last week just barely keeping my head up i tried mushroom a few day ago and for the first time in what felt like month could accept myself in fact i discovered i wa stuck in time two month earlier when i d been dumped my heart hadn t moved on but the universe relentlessly had and for hour the mushroom gave me clarity that i needed to move on and even had there wa a moment when time seemed to stop and suddenly i wa vaulted forward to the present over and around the intervening month i wa present again but just a sudden a the revelation had fallen upon me it wa stripped away and the black dog weighed down my chest once more shakily i put on my running clothes i considered my route an old standard roughly mile it d buy me a calculated more minute to think about this decision i cinched my lace i hate these shoe i struck out the door when my foot hit the pavement i realized this wasn t a regular jog i wasn t running to run i wa running to kill myself or not i d find out along the way suddenly the route and distance didn t matter i knew i d be going further than i d thought i started out at a normal pace and began upping my tempo i knew i wa out of shape i knew a single minute mile would be my limit a it had been on several of the past day but today wasn t those day i couldn t feel the exhaustion the pain of my body moment earlier all i could feel wa my body exhausted i wa trapped in my head i could push my body well past it s limit today because i wasn t leaving my heart or my head until my body hurt more around the first mile i started muttering to myself you ve never outrun yourself before but today is the day you beat yourself and i kept running i came upon a long flat stretch a narrow catwalk along the water s edge and i broke into a sprint i wa going to break myself now i pushed until i could feel the burn in my leg my throat and my lung i hadn t pushed myself like this in day week month or maybe even year i d forgotten what it felt like i started feeling light headed this wa to be alive but it couldn t last i ground to a halt and walked finally outside my head again but still thinking finally not drowning in my thought i d realized earlier what it is in those last moment it is quite literally drowning in your thought my brain take over dwelling on my past failure rejection loss and it s a if every iota of my brain power is diverted to these fruitless foray in my hippocampus every drip of processing is diverted suddenly my breathing reflex kick in i haven t been breathing i ve been drowning in my thought and with it a sense of fear and dread adrenaline course through my aorta spreading across my chest and dilating my bronchus fight or flight from my own past pushing myself achieves this same end but what am i running for what am i running toward i don t know and i feel so lost and unbound adrift and asea i thought again if this is your last run you re going out strong and started sprinting again i ran and i ran and i ran i ran through throng of people amidst cherry blossom who didn t know i wa probably running to my death but suddenly i didn t want to die anymore at least not yet not now and i started a new mantra this run saved my life and i realized i could say that every time i ran or biked or hiked or sat with friend or worked on a project or spoke to my mom but to do so i d have to get through those long dark minute of pure and intense pain i d have to learn to hurt myself again running hiking biking but i kept running a fast and a hard a i could i circled back around on my path it wa a lollipop route and i wa completing the candy and i pushed myself until i wa back on the inner leg of it the stem i pushed myself so hard i started vomiting in a homeless camp of all place i d had nothing to eat today and little yesterday i wa subsisting on coffee the bile came up black sour bitter much a the coffee had been going down it seemed a funny parallel and i decided then that i wanted to write about this i wanted to share my story because today i didn t kill myself i might have some part of me wanted to but i ran away and i ll keep running it s tough but i think i found something to run for again i d mostly stopped running age ago but i think this wa the motivation i needed to start again the rest of my life is in shamble and i don t know what i m doing but i can keep running i ll start running with a group i think and each time i ll let them know at the end this run saved my
