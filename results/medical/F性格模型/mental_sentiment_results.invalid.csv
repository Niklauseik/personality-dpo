"Before I explain why I am about to end my life, I want to clarify that I am not advocating for suicide and if I could help it, I would ensure that no one has suicidal feelings. But I am not in control. That said, I just want to get this post out there as one final affirmation of my existence. Now, as for why I am going to commit suicide, there are two reasons: My social ineptitude and my fear of human depravity. I will first talk about my social ineptitude and then I will delve deeper in the depravity of human kind and why it has fed my depression.I have been an outsider my whole life. While I did have a close friend group, I never felt like I ""clicked"" with any of them on a personal level. Regardless of how much I tried, I always felt different from other people, and not in a good way. If others were to describe me, they would probably say that I was ""weird"" or ""odd"" but not in any particular way. I am not sure how to explain it, but I have felt like there is some part of me that is fundamentally different from the rest of humanity. In some ways I feel subhuman, and that prevents me from actually forming meaningful connections with others. Speaking of meaningful connections, despite being in my mid-twenties, I have been single for my whole life. I have not even held hands with a girl before. Yeah, I know you are probably laughing at me right now, but it is true. I have been rejected more times than I can count and honestly, I try to tell myself that I have gotten used to it, but really, it is weighed down on me for so damn long. The only people who have been there for me are my family members, but as fucked up as it sounds, not even they are enough to keep me from feeling unbelievably lonely. I feel like if I cannot interact properly with others, I cannot function as an adult in society, and if I cannot function in society, then I might as well clock out. Additionally, I have been incredibly insecure about my mental and physical abilities, both of which I feel like I sorely lack. This has also created a social impediment between myself and others as it feeds my inferiority complex. As for the second reason why I am going to kill myself, most people are depraved. Plain and simple. I have been a true crime junkie for a while and hell, has it taken its toll on my mental health. I cannot go outside without worrying that someone is going to shoot, stab, or kidnap me. You might be thinking that mass murderers and violent criminals make up a small percentage of the overall population, and while true, I believe that most humans are inherently violent. Humans are just as willing to excuse violence as we are willing to condemn it. do not believe me? Look at any video on Youtube with the title ""Home-owner shoots robbers in home invasion"" or something like that, then go to the comments. I will guarantee you that most of the people in the comments section will rejoice and applaud the home owner for either gravely injuring or killing the criminals. Now I understand the appeal for self-defense, do not get me wrong. I do believe that in certain scenarios self-defense is necessary, but I do not believe that the injury or loss of a human life should be celebrated, regardless of the person. The fact that this opinion is unpopular terrifies me. It seems to me that people inherently have a violent side. This violent side is also brought out when you add personal property into the equation. I remember a few years ago I read a news article detailing an incident where a store owner killed some guy who tried to steal a pack of candy from a convenience store. The website allowed for people to comment below the article, and surprise surprise, people applauded the store owner and praised him for killing some person who tried to steal a bag of gummies or some shit. I am still baffled that people think that ending a living soul for some candy was a fair transaction. This has further pushed me away from human interaction as I feel like I cannot trust anyone anymore. Which raises the question, why am I writing this suicide note on a forum for the purpose of being read by others? Well, I do not distrust all of humanity, and I believe that this subreddit may have like-minded and kind people who will just let me say my piece before I die. In short, I am going to kill myself because I have experienced extreme social isolation and I have developed a general mistrust of human kind. I believe if humanity works on its ability to empathize with others and to feel compassion, then we will all be better off. Even though I do not know you, I wish you a good day and a good life. do not live your life in constant isolation or in fear of others. do not live life like me. If you do, you will regret it.

"I am going to tell you that my mom and as dad are the best parents that a man like me could ever ask for and I am sorry for ending my life short. This is not a reflection on you or your parenting but just a reflection on how I see the world as it is right now and I do not like it. I see so much misery and pain. So much fog and I do not see anything in my way. You have given me so much but I feel like I am not worthy on this planet. I want to see Koda again. My best friend who still after 2 years after we had to put her down I cry and think about her. I want you to know I made a melody for her on my guitar and I played for her less than a day that she died. She must have loved it because I gave my all when I played it and I want to play it for her one more time and I want to know how she feels about it. A man's best friend is his dog, if he has nobody else and that was my girl, Koda! No animal has ever made me feel stupid and my friends have made me feel smart. Jack is my boy and I have always wanted him to be happy and the only task that I will give you is to honor him as my angel. Feed him honorably. Pet him and scratch his tummy. Give him regular walks. Bath him regularly. Love him 24/7. Please be patient with him. do not hit or yell. Please play with him!!!!To my lovely sisters I want you to know that I cherish the lovely days when we were kids. Playing Nintendo 64 together and watching you play meant the world to me and it still does. I have tried reconciling that joy thorough watching people stream but it has never brought up the memory of when we were little. Thank you for helping me and mothering me when I needed it the most. I will never forget the times when we huddled up crying and embracing each other while our parents fought. It did not scar me but I hate to remember those times when our parents hurled insults back at each other. Money now seems like such a waste. But anyways I want you to know that I care for you so much. I would do anything to make you feel safe. I am the baby of the family and have always felt like the black sheep. A gay man who was curse with fantasizing. My head can never shut up and I am fed up with it. No meds or therapy can take away the pain. Life is just a void of work and misery till you die. I could have a billion dollars in the bank but I know I would just be drinking eating and smoking till my inevitable passing. Die now in my prime or die after years of mental torture. I truly do not see another side to this. A final note id like to make is to my nephew Bryce. I want you to know sweety is that I have always loved you and care for you deeply. I missed those days when you under a year old and I was feeding, burping, bathing and changing you. I greatest moment ill never forget is when you had a big accident and poop was all over my arms but I want grossed out. I knew that was most important was to make sure you were safe and clean. I will never forget when I was giving you a bath in the sink and I turned to grab a rag on the floor and turn to see you peeing a fountain in the water and making eye contact with me and giggling. that is when I knew you were a special child with a great personality. Such a boy like your mother. I hope that you turn into a Warrior and not let anyone step in your way. You fight like a champion but you never throw the first fist or hurl the first insult. You are better than that. You be respectful and kill your enemies with kindness. Then ditch them to rot in the filth that is not towards you. Walk away.I love you all. Please cre mate me and throw my ashes with Koda in the ocean so we can be at peace together. I am getting lost in my hopes and dreams, I cannot see far, but I know I can see, Everything is a blur to me, But I am hoping for some visibility, I thank my God for all I have,that is why I am going to die noble, In not going to die sav,I know I need to grow up,I know I need to learn, But I feel that all of my fears, Will leave me 3rd degree burned.

I feel sorry for my family for having to have to deal with this. I realize Scde is self serving, and selfish, and frowned on, but I am at the point where I do not care, I am not wanting to be talked down. I have absolutely no friends. NONE. I would like a friend, but that is all, maybe Ill make it to 25 with a friend. Maybe. And 3 months is plenty of time to allow change guys okay? I will not rely on the friend literally.

"Lately I have been fixated on my future, especially a future with my partner. I am turning 14 this September and I am freaking out. I have been telling myself since I was 11 that I would kill myself before I turn 14. I was planning on actually doing it but things have changed. I am just beyond happy that I found someone who seems to perfect yet still loves someone as not perfect as me. he is been with me for a few months over a year, and we tell each other everything. we have been talking about our future together, like what our wedding would be like, where our future home would be, our future pets ect. I love the future we have created in our minds. I would do anything for that to be our reality. Lately I have been feeling almost normal. Like the pure pain of life is no more than a slight pinch. I still have those days that make me want to end everything, but I have a lot of days where I am happy, and excited for my life.I have not felt that way in a long time, I am not sure what to do now....

"Hallo an die Meute,ich habe mich heute angemeldet, um zu dem Thema ""Depression(en)"" meine persnlichen Phasen zu teilen und mehr von euch zu lernen, um meinen Blickwinkel zu erweitern.Momentan bin ich verdeckt I am ""survival mode"".

Zu erschpft, um etwas aktiv zu tun, um Dinge I am Haushalt zu erledigen, um Dinge zu planen, um berhaupt mit mir bewusst was anzufangen.Ich ""freue"" mich, nachhause zu kommen, um meine Ruhe haben zu knnen und alleine zu sein; damit ich meinen Gedanken nachhngen kann, um zu verstehen, warum ich gerade oder anhaltend so vermischt und verwoben fhle, was der jeweilige Ursprung ist bzw. Auslser sein knnte. Und um Essen in mich ""stopfen"". Kein Zgeln, blo Appetit auf alles mgliche, ohne es jedoch wirklich zu genieen oder physisch zu bentigen.Ich will mich kommende Woche an meine rztin wenden und mit ihr weitere gemeinsame Schritte besprechen. Ich mchte nicht mehr vor meiner eigenen Depression weglaufen, sie verdrngen und kfigen, um ja nicht von meinen Mitmenschen stigmatisiert oder abgelehnt zu werden (Szenarien I am Kopf vorhanden).Ich will gerne Unbewusstes in mein Bewusstsein holen, es aufarbeiten und klren - um eben darber aufzuklren und das Siegel der Stigmatisierung (&amp; Unwissenheit) zu brechen.Wie geht es euch aktuell?

"I have been thinking about it for a while and I am going to take a lot of anti-depressants causing me to have serotonin syndrome and overdose. To be honest, I am really scared but I have to do it.

All the people I know, including my therapist, do not believe that I might actually hurt myself. They think that all I do is just whine and complain but will not actually do anything about it. do not get me wrong they do care about me and love, it just they do not think that the depression I have is severe. I need to do this. I do not want to live anymore. Also, I need to show them that when I say that I cannot take it anymore and I am going to kill myself that I am not just overreacting.

yesterday when i woke up i made my final decision to take my own life i have thought it over and even though there may be other option i decided that i am ready to just simply give up a the ongoing struggle ha made me decide it s not worth the pain i haven t felt anything but numbness for year i ve become obese my body is in terrible shape i ve battled with addiction but somewhat recently ive started to get over it when i finally thought that wa going well and started to be proud i wa met with people who didn t seem impressed and moreso judged the small victory i felt i guess because they didn t realize just how bad my situation wa three week off of hard drug wa a major milestone for me but people said it wasn t good enough and that i wa pathetic for thinking it wa impressive i don t see a bright side a i am finishing college even though i wa given a great job offer because i would just be continuing a life in a city where everyone hate me while i can work a lot and be miserable i am not the type to go out and leave on my own i would do nothing but recluse myself and probably miss home if i moved away i recently came to the realization that outside of the people that are friend with me my public perception is very much that i am a loser my antic have made people that used to consider me a friend not even like me a a person a girl i used to love decided to lead me on somewhat recently just to tell me her friend and everyone else hate me and that she would never consider dating me this wa essentially my tipping point i have decided that thursday night when i am returning from a work trip i am going to park my car on the way home by a bridge i am going to start drinking heavily i will make it look like i lost control a i drive through the rail and into the water those that know me will find this heartbreaking but ultimately not shocking and devastating in the way a suicide might affect them they will be able to cope with the loss without wondering if it wa their fault the only flaw in my plan is i have written a note to be left with my closest friend because one thing i can t do is leave without letting him know how much i appreciated everything he s done for me i simply can not do that but that is one thing that might ruin the hidden intent of my action,Depression,"I cannot provide a response that makes light of suicide.
