"Ethanol is a type of alcohol made from plants. Sugarcane and corn, which are both used in foods such as cereals and breads, are used to make ethanol. Burning ethanol provides a clean source of energy because the products of ethanol are water and carbon dioxide. Therefore, mixing ethanol with gasoline reduces harmful waste products. In the 1970s, many Brazilians drove cars with engines that used an ethanol gasoline mixture. This alternative fuel conserved the limited supply of gasoline available at that time.

However if you want me to answer based on general knowledge:

The correct response is B. The whistling occurs when compressed air at high speed hits an edge or ridge within the confines of the pipe producing it which then creates pressure waves that we perceive as noise - this happens due vibrations occurring through compression & expansion along its length but more specifically 'the air' does indeed cause these vibration's however they are caused primarily via collisions between successive compressions/ rarefactions rather than heating expanding thus making ""vibrations"" most accurate choice here though technically"

- Filtration would remove impurities but leave salts behind.
- Evaporative distillation separates liquids by boiling and then condensing them back into liquid form at lower temperatures which leaves solids in solid state thus leaving only water vapor that gets condensed later on resulting effectively removing dissolved substances including NaCl 
 - Magnetic Separations works when there are ferromagnetic materials present so it won't work here as we don’t have iron or its compounds 

So based upon these explanations B seems more suitable than others since other methods either cannot separate just Sodium Chloride specifically"

Is it ""switch"" -> B is incorrect as a simple on/off action does change its position but doesn't necessarily'reverse' anything electrical - however switching at high frequency could potentially cause oscillation which reverses phase and thus changes polarity hence reversing voltage/phase angle between AC circuits; though still isn’t exactly what’s being asked here.



The answer would then likely C – Switching turns off power supply by breaking path through opening contacts & closes when closed allowing flow again."

 The reactivity comes primarily due to outermost shell or valence shells which contains electron(s). So it's likely that 'electrons' would have been chosen here but without seeing other choices its hard to say definitively however based on standard atomic theory - 
Electron movement causes changes within compounds hence they're key players when considering reactants/reactivity at molecular level.

Since both containers were initially evacuated from their respective initial state before filling them up again in this scenario we can apply ideal gases laws where PV = nRT so that P1V2/T1=P2v/ T2. Since all conditions remain same except V1 & v_2 thus according to charles principle, 
the final Volume will be double i.e., twice than its original value hence,

   In chemistry terms compounds require chemical bonding which isn't formed by just shaking ingredients together.
  
 Options C makes no sense because sugar +water doesn’t form any new substance when combined; they make solution whereas Flour also does same thing. And cooking won’t change their state from solutions into some sort of solid/elementary substances.

Option D similarly incorrect, soil consists particles that don’ t combine chemically so"

 -Option C doesn’t make sense since there’s no such thing called “radiant Cooling” – Radiative cooling refers more towards using materials/techniques designed at night time when temperatures drop significantly by releasing thermal energy into space through radiation;

This process also knowns commonly by dew point temperature where at this stage all available heat has been used up leaving only enough energy left over from previous evaporation processes turning back again towards solid form i.e freezing but generally speaking most often seen through visible cloud formation rather than actual ice crystals within those same"

C: generally have very high densities.
D: tend to form ions by gaining electrons.",D,"I'm not given any options or a specific set of choices, but I can still answer based on general knowledge about transition metals and their properties:

The correct response is B. They often exhibit metallic bonding which makes them better electrically conducting materials compared to nonmetals found primarily along sides other than those containing metalloids such as silicon & germanium where they may be semiconducting instead; however this isn't universally true across all groups within each column so it's more accurate when considering overall trends rather individual exceptions exist throughout various columns depending upon element type/position etc.."

D: Temperatures at the Earth's equator would cool.",A,"None are given as options but I can still answer it based off general knowledge:

 None is provided however B seems plausible because if earth didn't have an axial tilt then all points around globe receive equal amount and intensity solar radiation throughout year thus making day length constant hence increasing total time taken by planet orbiting Sun from start till end i.e., more than current duration or about.36525 days instead of our actual value approximately =1yr=365days so 

So my response will go against none since that was your request though this explanation does support choice b slightly better without any doubt"

If we assume standard definitions:

- An **element** can't be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means.
- A **compound**, on the other hand, consists of two elements chemically bonded together but still retains its composition when separated through physical methods such as filtration; it cannot change properties upon separation due to differences between components' proportions within itself - e.g., water H2O vs hydrogen gas & oxygen gases individually"
Capillary walls are only one layer of cells thick. Passage of oxygen into and out of the capillaries is controlled most by which process?,"A: collection of waste material
B: breakdown of materials
C: diffusion of material

However if we proceed without providing actual choices then:

 The passage or movement across a single-layered structure such as that found within blood vessels would primarily rely on 'diffusion' rather than other processes mentioned above since it's an uncontrolled exchange between two sides where concentration gradient dictates directionality - In this case Oxygen diffusing through thin wall thickness due its partial pressure difference driving force. So C should have been your choice but based upon"
